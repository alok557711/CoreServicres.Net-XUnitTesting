# CoreServicres.Net-XUnitTesting
This article will demonstrate how to write Unit Test Cases for CRUD operations in Asp.Net Core Web API with xUnit project.
In this demonstration, we will write the Unit Test Cases for CRUD(CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE) operations.
We will write at least 3 different Unit Test Cases for 3 different scenarios. In this demonstration,
we will not implement CRUD operation in Asp.Net Core Web API because we have already written one article on this previously on this.
We have used that code which we have written for the previous article.
